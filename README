Weather API

This is a python file. In this project we are pulling an API and compiling it in tkinter using canvas.
In the input we enter the city that we want and 
we get the degree, humidity and other data's about that city.

For running the project open cmd in your desktop, write "python 'passoffile'"  and enter.
